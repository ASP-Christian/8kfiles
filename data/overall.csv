ONCOR ELECTRIC DELIVERY CO LLC,"DALLAS (Feb. 27, 2024) — Oncor Electric Delivery Company LLC (“Oncor”) today reported twelve months ended December 31, 2023 net income of $864 million compared to twelve months ended December 31, 2022 net income of $905 million. This $41 million decrease was driven by higher costs associated with increases in invested capital (primarily borrowing costs and depreciation), higher operation and maintenance expense (primarily regulatory asset amortization and self-insurance reserve accrual recovery amounts in new base rates) and the write-off of rate base disallowances recorded in the first quarter of 2023 resulting from the Public Utility Commission of Texas’ (“PUCT”) final order in Oncor’s comprehensive base rate review in PUCT Docket No. 53601, partially offset by higher revenues primarily attributable to updated interim rates to reflect increases in invested capital, increases in transmission billing units as a result of certain increases in average Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (“ERCOT”) peak demand, the new base rates implemented May 1, 2023 following the PUCT’s final order in the base rate review and customer growth. Oncor’s reported net income of $181 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared favorably to net income of $164 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022. This $17 million increase was driven by higher revenues primarily attributable to updated interim rates to reflect increases in invested capital, the new base rates implemented May 1, 2023 and customer growth, partially offset by higher costs associated with increases in invested capital (primarily borrowing costs and depreciation), higher operation and maintenance expense (primarily regulatory asset amortization and self-insurance reserve accrual recovery amounts in new base rates) and lower customer consumption due to milder weather in the quarter. Oncor’s total distribution base revenues in the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 increased 7.4% (9.2% increase on a weather-normalized basis). The change in Oncor’s total distribution base revenues in the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 included a 9.8% increase in distribution base revenues from residential customers (13.9% increase on a weather-normalized basis) and an 8.2% increase in distribution base revenues from large commercial and industrial (“LC&I”) customers. Oncor’s total distribution base revenues in the three months ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased 11.3% (15.2% increase on a weather-normalized basis). The change in Oncor’s total distribution base revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 included a 15.5% increase in distribution base revenues from residential customers (24.0% increase on a weather-normalized basis) and a 13.5% increase in distribution base revenues from LC&I customers. Financial and operational results are provided in Tables A, B, C, and D below. In 2023, Oncor set company records for annual active and new generation and retail transmission POI requests in queue. At December 31, 2023, Oncor had 763 active generation and retail transmission POI requests in queue, representing a 25% increase as compared to December 31, 2022. Of the 481 active generation POI requests in queue at December 31, 2023, 46% are solar, 42% are storage, 9% are wind and 3% are gas. Additionally, in 2023, Oncor entered 332 new generation and retail transmission POI requests into queue, representing a 19% increase as compared to 2022. Oncor continued to be active in sustainability matters in 2023. In May, Oncor published its green bond spend report relating to its inaugural green bond issuance. In October, an independent third party environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) ratings company issued its annual ESG risk rating of Oncor, improving Oncor’s rating and ranking Oncor in the top 2 percent of electric utilities rated by that company at that time, reflecting lower ESG risk. Also, in 2023, Oncor was named as a 2023 Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion by Disability:IN. As of February 26, 2024, Oncor’s available liquidity, consisting of cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under its existing credit facilities, commercial paper program and accounts receivable facility (“AR Facility”), totaled $2.5 billion. Oncor expects cash flows from operations combined with long-term debt issuances and credit agreements as well as availability under its existing credit facilities, commercial paper program and AR Facility to be sufficient to fund current obligations, projected working capital requirements, maturities of long-term debt and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. Oncor currently expects to issue approximately $2.0 billion of long-term debt securities in 2024.",2024-02-27,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001193311/000119312524047069/d793311dex991.htm
