This $41 million decrease was driven by higher costs associated with increases in invested capital (primarily borrowing costs and depreciation), higher operation and maintenance expense (primarily regulatory asset amortization and self-insurance reserve accrual recovery amounts in new base rates) and the write-off of rate base disallowances recorded in the first quarter of 2023 resulting from the Public Utility Commission of Texas’ (“PUCT”) final order in Oncor’s comprehensive base rate review in PUCT Docket No. 53601, partially offset by higher revenues primarily attributable to updated interim rates to reflect increases in invested capital, increases in transmission billing units as a result of certain increases in average Electric Reliability Council of Texas, Inc. (“ERCOT”) peak demand, the new base rates implemented May 1, 2023 following the PUCT’s final order in the base rate review and customer growth. Oncor’s reported net income of $181 million in the three months ended December 31, 2023 compared favorably to net income of $164 million in the three months ended December 31, 2022. This $17 million increase was driven by higher revenues primarily attributable to updated interim rates to reflect increases in invested capital, the new base rates implemented May 1, 2023 and customer growth, partially offset by higher costs associated with increases in invested capital (primarily borrowing costs and depreciation), higher operation and maintenance expense (primarily regulatory asset amortization and self-insurance reserve accrual recovery amounts in new base rates) and lower customer consumption due to milder weather in the quarter. Oncor’s total distribution base revenues in the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the twelve months ended December 31, 2022 increased 7.4% (9.2% increase on a weather-normalized basis). The change in Oncor’s total distribution base revenues in the twelve months ended December 31, 2023 included a 9.8% increase in distribution base revenues from residential customers (13.9% increase on a weather-normalized basis) and an 8.2% increase in distribution base revenues from large commercial and industrial (“LC&I”) customers. Oncor’s total distribution base revenues in the three months ended December 31, 2023 as compared to the three months ended December 31, 2022 increased 11.3% (15.2% increase on a weather-normalized basis). The change in Oncor’s total distribution base revenues in the fourth quarter of 2023 included a 15.5% increase in distribution base revenues from residential customers (24.0% increase on a weather-normalized basis) and a 13.5% increase in distribution base revenues from LC&I customers. Financial and operational results are provided in Tables A, B, C, and D below. In 2023, Oncor set company records for annual active and new generation and retail transmission POI requests in queue. At December 31, 2023, Oncor had 763 active generation and retail transmission POI requests in queue, representing a 25% increase as compared to December 31, 2022. Of the 481 active generation POI requests in queue at December 31, 2023, 46% are solar, 42% are storage, 9% are wind and 3% are gas. Additionally, in 2023, Oncor entered 332 new generation and retail transmission POI requests into queue, representing a 19% increase as compared to 2022. Oncor continued to be active in sustainability matters in 2023. In May, Oncor published its green bond spend report relating to its inaugural green bond issuance. In October, an independent third party environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) ratings company issued its annual ESG risk rating of Oncor, improving Oncor’s rating and ranking Oncor in the top 2 percent of electric utilities rated by that company at that time, reflecting lower ESG risk. Also, in 2023, Oncor was named as a 2023 Best Places to Work for Disability Inclusion by Disability:IN. As of February 26, 2024, Oncor’s available liquidity, consisting of cash on hand and available borrowing capacity under its existing credit facilities, commercial paper program and accounts receivable facility (“AR Facility”), totaled $2.5 billion. Oncor expects cash flows from operations combined with long-term debt issuances and credit agreements as well as availability under its existing credit facilities, commercial paper program and AR Facility to be sufficient to fund current obligations, projected working capital requirements, maturities of long-term debt and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months. Oncor currently expects to issue approximately $2.0 billion of long-term debt securities in 2024.",2024-02-27,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001193311/000119312524047069/d793311dex991.htm

Immunome Inc. (IMNM),"On February 5, 2024, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Ayala Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Ayala, pursuant to which we will acquire Ayala’s AL101 and AL102 programs and assume certain of Ayala’s liabilities associated with the acquired assets, or the Ayala Asset Purchase. We expect the Ayala Asset Purchase to close late in the first quarter of 2024 or early in the second quarter of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, including approval of Ayala’s stockholders. Additionally, on December 22, 2023, we entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement with Atreca, Inc., or Atreca, pursuant to which we will acquire certain antibody-related assets and materials owned by Atreca, or the Atreca Asset Purchase, and collectively with the Ayala Asset Purchase, the Asset Purchases. We anticipate the Atreca Asset Purchase to close in the first half of 2024, subject to customary closing conditions, including the approval Atreca’s stockholders. We submitted an IND for the IMM-BCP-01 program to the FDA in November 2021. In March 2022, the FDA communicated that the clinical study can be initiated for our antibody cocktail for the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 following a brief clinical hold, and we initiated the Phase 1b study of IMM-BCP-01 in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 in June 2022. On January 6, 2023, we announced that we successfully completed dosing of the first cohort of patients in a Phase 1b study with no significant treatment-related adverse events. We have decided to seek a partner in order to continue the trial and for any further development activities. No assurance can be given that we will be able to find a suitable partner for IMM-BCP-01, that any potential partner will offer us satisfactory partnering terms or that any such partner will have success in its development and commercialization efforts. There are several other companies developing FAP-targeted radioligand therapies which may represent the most direct competition to our 177Lu-FAP program. Novartis is advancing a FAP-targeted radioligand therapy (177Lu-FAP-2286) that was acquired from Clovis Oncology and is currently in Phase 1/2. Clovis previously presented Phase 1 data for FAP-2286 (June 2022.) In December 2023, Eli Lilly and Company acquired POINT Biopharma, which is developing a FAP-targeted radioligand therapy (PNT2004) that is currently in Phase 1. POINT presented a trial-in-progress poster discussing trial design (June 2023) and expects to release data from that trial in the first half of 2024. In addition, POINT has disclosed two preclinical radioligand programs targeting FAP. Yantai LNC Biotechnology has also initiated a Phase 1 trial for another FAP-targeted radioligand therapy (LNC1004.) Additionally, our 177Lu-FAP program faces competition from competitors who may have superior access to a consistent supply of radioactive isotopes. Further, among other things, the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, or the IRA, has multiple provisions that may impact the prices of drug products that are both sold into the Medicare program and throughout the United States. Starting in 2023, CMS began to implement the program in which a manufacturer of a drug or biological product covered by Medicare Parts B or D must pay a rebate to the federal government if the drug product’s price increases faster than the rate of inflation. This calculation is made on a drug product by drug product basis and the amount of the rebate owed to the federal government is directly dependent on the volume of a drug product that is paid for by Medicare Parts B or D. Additionally, starting in payment year 2026, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, or CMS, will negotiate drug prices annually for a select number of single source Part D drugs without generic or biosimilar competition. On August 29, 2023, the list of the first ten drugs that will be subject to price negotiations was published, although the Medicare drug price negotiation program is currently subject to legal challenges. CMS will also negotiate drug prices for a select number of Part B drugs starting for payment year 2028. If a drug product is selected by CMS for negotiation, it is expected that the revenue generated from such drug will decrease. CMS has and will continue to issue and update guidance as these programs are implemented. The IRA permits HHS to implement many of these provisions through guidance, as opposed to regulation, for the initial years. HHS has and will continue to issue and update guidance as these programs as implemented. It is unclear how the IRA will be implemented but is likely to have a significant impact on the pharmaceutical industry. Further, on February 14, 2023, HHS released a report outlining three new models for testing by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Innovation Center which will be evaluated on their ability to lower the cost of drugs, promote accessibility, and improve quality of care. It is unclear whether the models will be utilized in any health reform measures in the future. Additionally, on December 7, 2023, the Biden administration announced an initiative to control the price of prescription drugs through the use of march-in rights under the Bayh-Dole Act. On December 8, 2023, the National Institute of Standards and Technology published for comment a Draft Interagency Guidance Framework for Considering the Exercise of March-In Rights which for the first time includes the price of a product as one factor an agency can use when deciding to exercise march-in rights. While march-in rights have not previously been exercised, it is uncertain if that will continue under the new framework.",2024-02-13,https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001472012/000110465924019883/tm245878d1_ex99-2.htm
